/**
 * Local design primitives for the internal tool. They deliberately mirror the dashboard's
 * design-components (same tokens, same glassmorphic surfaces, same badge/button palettes) without
 * importing them: the internal tool is a separate Next app with its own Tailwind build, and pulling
 * in `@hexclave/dashboard-ui-components` would drag along the dashboard's provider stack. Keep the
 * visuals here in sync with apps/dashboard/DESIGN-GUIDE.md.
