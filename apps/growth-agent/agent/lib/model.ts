/**
 * Z.AI's NATIVE thinking switch, which is what actually turns glm-5.2's reasoning off.
 *
 * WHY THE GENERIC `reasoning` FIELD IS NOT ENOUGH: the AI SDK's provider-agnostic effort level is
 * translated to each provider's native API by the gateway, and the gateway's translation table
 * covers OpenAI, Anthropic, Google/Vertex and Bedrock only. Z.AI is not in it, so `reasoning:
 * "none"` is accepted and then silently dropped. We measured exactly that: across a 150-request run
 * on 2026-08-11 with `reasoning: "none"` already set, reasoning was still 64.0% of generated tokens
 * (221,215 of 345,871) — statistically indistinguishable from the 62.2% baseline before the flag
 * existed. An earlier 50-request run read 36.7% and briefly looked like a partial win; it was
 * sample noise.
 *
 * Z.AI's own API takes `thinking: { type: "enabled" | "disabled" }`, and glm-5.2 supports the
 * toggle (the gateway catalog lists `reasoning_options: [{type:"toggle"}, {type:"effort", values:
 * ["high","xhigh"]}]` — note there is no "low", which is why there is no cheap middle ground).
 * Vercel's docs are explicit that a reasoning-related entry in `providerOptions` "takes full
 * precedence" over the top-level `reasoning` value, so this is the setting that wins.
 *
 * Keyed under BOTH `zai` and `wafer` deliberately. The model id's namespace is `zai`, but the
 * request is routed to the `wafer` provider, and the gateway's documentation is ambiguous about
 * which of the two names it matches provider options against (its own examples use the model
 * namespace in one place and the serving provider in another). Unknown keys are ignored, so
 * covering both is free and removes the guess.

          // 2026-08-10 and measured the result from eve's own step telemetry (`eve logs --events`,
          // 92 model calls): 65 tok/s aggregate, median 60, max 130, unimodal. That is `alibaba`'s

          //
          // So: trust a measured run over the catalog's compliance flags. If a privacy filter is
          // ever required, add it AND re-measure tok/s, and expect to trade most of the speed for
          // it. The provider-independent control that does not cost throughput is the PII gate on
