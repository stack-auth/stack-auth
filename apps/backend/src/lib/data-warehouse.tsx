// Core logic for the Data Warehouse app (`data-warehouse-alpha`): a per-project
// ClickHouse database plus a dedicated ClickHouse user, on the same ClickHouse
// instance that serves analytics.
//
// Isolation has to come from the connecting user, not the database: row policies
// filter rows but don't restrict which databases a query may name, so granting
// the shared `limited_user` access to one project's warehouse would expose it to
// every other project. Each warehouse user also holds the `analytics_reader`
// role (see scripts/clickhouse-migrations.ts), so it keeps the project's usual
// analytics access and can join it against the project's own tables, with
// `SQL_project_id`/`SQL_branch_id` pinned as CONST settings.
//
// Alpha limitations, all deliberate:
// - TODO(data-warehouse-ga): no storage accounting; ClickHouse has no per-database
//   size limit, so a project can fill disk shared with analytics.
// - TODO(data-warehouse-ga): no deprovisioning; deleting a tenancy or uninstalling
//   the app leaves the ClickHouse database and user in place.
// - No downgrade enforcement: losing the entitlement blocks provisioning and
//   rotation, but an existing ClickHouse user stays active.
// - Per-user ClickHouse settings are a snapshot taken at provision/rotation time,
//   so a plan upgrade only takes effect on the next rotation. `/analytics/query`
//   is unaffected; it computes its timeout per request.
// - One database per project, not per branch (the database is named after the
//   project id, so a second branch would collide).
