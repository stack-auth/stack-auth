 *
 * Two-phase concurrency story:
 *
 *   1. Fast path — O(1) read against the `subscriptionMapByCustomer`
 *      LFold. That LFold is a `GroupBy → Sort → LFold` chain with no
 *      TimeFold in its dependencies, so its row-change triggers cascade
 *      synchronously during `bulldozerWriteSubscription`'s `setRow`
 *      (unlike `ownedProducts`, which sits downstream of a TimeFold and
 *      only catches up when `pg_cron` drains the queue). That means
 *      callers that just committed a sub mutation upstream (the DELETE
 *      cancel route, the Stripe webhook handler) see their own writes
 *      here and we don't spuriously regrant on stale data.
 *
 *   2. Slow path — if the fast path found nothing, re-check against the
 *      Prisma Subscription source-of-truth under SERIALIZABLE isolation
 *      and insert atomically so two concurrent callers can't both create
 *      a duplicate free sub. `retryTransaction` handles P2028
 *      serialization failures by retrying; on the retry the other
 *      caller's row is visible and we skip the insert.
 *
 * TODO: once "default products" lands and the free plan is granted
 * implicitly by config rather than a DB row, this whole regrant dance
 * goes away. The slow-path Prisma write is also a pre-Bulldozer-
 * deprecation artefact — when Bulldozer owns subscription writes
 * directly, the SERIALIZABLE Prisma tx becomes a Bulldozer insert with
 * its own concurrency story.
