 * Asks the growth agent to write the prose for a round's questions.

 * description of it, and the *shape* of the question — never the true value and never the options —
 * and returns only a question sentence and a one-line explanation. Everything the game scores was
 * already computed from real rows in quiz-facts.ts. If this contract ever loosened, the game could
 * assert a false fact about a customer's own product on the one surface whose whole premise is that
 * the numbers are trustworthy.
 *
 * Failure is not fatal. Every fact already carries deterministic `templateText`, so a failed or
 * malformed turn degrades the round's *wording* and nothing else; the caller records
 * `textSource: "template"` on the round so the degradation is recorded rather than hidden.
