/**
 * Growth orchestration, workflow-engine edition: the successor of the v1 cron engine (engine.ts).
 * Where the v1 engine was one global periodic tick that walked EVERY run/brief/milestone in the
 * database, every function here is scoped to a single entity (one analysis run, one brief, one
 * branch's milestones) so that ordinary customer-editable workflows can drive each lifecycle by
 * calling the internal/growth-server routes.
 *
 * The idempotency chain is inherited unchanged from the v1 engine (see the comment at the top of
 * engine.ts): CAS claims bump attempts, the agent echoes attempts back, content writes are
 * natural-key upserts, and unique constraints backstop everything. On top of that, every entry
 * point here must additionally be safe for ANY server-scope caller repeating it at ANY time —
 * workflow run tokens authenticate as plain server auth, so the routes cannot trust the caller to
 * be "the" workflow for this entity. Hence: all lookups are tenancy-scoped, and every mutation is
 * a CAS against growth-table state, making hostile or duplicated calls no-ops.
 *
 * Constants and pure DAG helpers are duplicated from engine.ts on purpose: this file is the
 * canonical copy; engine.ts keeps its own until it is deleted in the migration cutover (we may not
 * import from it, since it dies, and we may not edit it, since it is still live until then).

 * tickGrowthAnalysisRun, and advanceRunTransitionsForRun's report re-dispatch) are plain
 * route-handler calls that never hold a Postgres transaction open, which is exactly the constraint
 * the metric loaders demand (see the pre-transaction fan-out comment in lib/growth/actions.ts's
 * activation path: metric loads fan out to ClickHouse and the read replica and must not run inside
 * a transaction). The loader fan-out takes on the order of seconds; that is acceptable for one
 * tick, and since a run has exactly one compute-metrics phase row, one tick can execute this at
 * most once.
 *
 * CAS claim semantics mirror claimAndDispatchPhase's PENDING→DISPATCHED claim, but collapse the
 * usual DISPATCHED→RUNNING handshake (agent-writes.ts's start route sets RUNNING + startedAt +
 * heartbeatAt when Eve picks the phase up) into the single claim write: there is no external agent
 * whose pickup DISPATCHED would be waiting on, so the phase goes PENDING→RUNNING directly with
 * dispatchedAt/startedAt/heartbeatAt all set to the claim time. If the process dies mid-execution,
 * the phase is a RUNNING row with a stale heartbeat — precisely what isPhaseStuck reaps — so the
 * existing stuck-reaping and FAILED→PENDING retry machinery apply unchanged.
 *
 * A throw (ClickHouse down, loaders failing) records FAILED like an Eve-reported failure, and after
 * GROWTH_PHASE_MAX_ATTEMPTS such failures the run itself fails. That is intended, not an oversight:
 * data-analysis is meaningless without the metric store it reads, so a run that cannot compute
