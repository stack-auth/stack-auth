// The two canonical Growth workflow sources. These are ordinary customer
// workflows: Growth seeds them into the tenancy's workflow list (see
// lib/growth/workflows.ts), the customer may read/edit/delete them like any
// other workflow, and Growth NEVER auto-updates an existing definition — it
// only recreates a missing one (the watchdog's ensure pass).
//
// The sources are STATIC strings with no interpolation whatsoever: tenancy
// identity comes from the per-run credentials the workflow engine injects
// (the run token authenticates as ordinary server auth), so the same bytes
// work for every project. Keeping the strings byte-stable is load-bearing —
// edit detection (lib/growth/workflows.ts getGrowthWorkflowStates) is a plain
// string compare of the stored latest version's source against these consts.
//
// Style note: the sources live in template literals, so they must not contain
// backtick characters or "${" sequences. All string building inside the
// workflow code uses concatenation.
//
// Runtime facts these sources rely on (verified against
// lib/workflows/runtime-source.tsx, route-handlers/smart-request.tsx, and
// smart-router.tsx — re-verify when touching either side):
//   - The invocation prelude sets globalThis.__HEXCLAVE_WORKFLOWS_INPUT__,
//     whose credentials field is { apiUrl, projectId, branchId,
//     secretServerKey } (the secretServerKey slot carries the run token).
//   - smart-request reads server auth from the x-stack-project-id,
//     x-stack-branch-id, x-stack-access-type, and x-stack-secret-server-key
//     headers.
//   - The public path of app/api/latest/... routes is /api/v1/... (the
//     smart router maps the version prefix), and credentials.apiUrl is the
//     bare API origin (same value the SDK receives as baseUrl).
//   - event.type inside the runtime is the WIRE type: "schedule" for
//     schedule occurrences and "custom.<name>" for custom events. runKey
//     functions therefore see the "custom." prefix — the watchdog's
//     runKey-derivation helpers below MUST stay in sync with the runKey
//     functions embedded in the sources (asserted in workflow-sources.test.ts).
