/*
  Deployments move from Vercel to Marshal (the Fly.io-backed container
  runtime). No data migration: there are no backwards-compatible deployments
  projects, and upload rows are ephemeral (cleared below so the new reference
  column can be NOT NULL).

  Warnings:

  - You are about to drop the column `buildCommand` on the `DeploymentService` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `framework` on the `DeploymentService` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `installCommand` on the `DeploymentService` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `outputDirectory` on the `DeploymentService` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `vercelProjectId` on the `DeploymentService` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `vercelDeploymentId` on the `DeploymentRun` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `vercelDeploymentUrl` on the `DeploymentRun` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `objectKey` on the `DeploymentSourceUpload` table. All the data in the column will be lost.

-- file writes, kept all the way through the wire and this column so nothing has
-- to translate between two spellings of one thing — and duplicate ports become
-- impossible by construction rather than by a constraint.
--
-- There is deliberately no service-level visibility column: a service is public
-- exactly when one of its ports is, so the two can never drift apart. `protocol`
-- sits on the port for the same reason — a container speaking HTTP on one port
-- and raw TCP on another is a normal thing to want, and a service-level protocol
-- cannot express it.

-- Whether the service takes public ingress. A property of the SERVICE rather
-- than of a port: Fly's proxy listener set is per-app, not per-address, so every
-- declared port answers on every address the app holds. "Public 3000, private
-- 5432" is not something the runtime can do, so the flag lives where the truth
-- does instead of on each port where it could only lie.
ADD COLUMN "isPublic" BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,

-- The port rules, stated by the database because this column is the ONLY record
-- of whether a service is public.
--
-- Each rule goes through its own IMMUTABLE function: a CHECK constraint may not
-- contain a subquery, and walking a JSON object means one. Keeping them separate
-- (rather than one big validator) is what keeps the violated constraint's NAME a
-- useful diagnostic.
--
-- Every function returns the PASSING value for a non-object input, so that
-- "ports is not an object" is reported by the single constraint that says so.
-- Postgres evaluates a row's CHECK constraints in no particular order, and
-- jsonb_each on a scalar raises a hard error rather than returning false —
-- without the guard, a scalar would surface as "cannot deconstruct a scalar"
-- instead of a named violation.

-- FLY.IO PLATFORM LIMITATIONS, deliberately NOT stated as CHECK constraints:
-- a public service must be all-HTTP (raw TCP carries no SNI or Host header, so a
-- shared public IPv4 cannot tell which app a connection is for — verified
-- against real Fly), and a public service must declare at least one port.
--
-- Unlike the port-SHAPE rules above, which say what these columns may contain
-- and stay true forever, these are facts about the RUNTIME we deploy onto and
-- are expected to move: public TCP is a dedicated IPv4 per service away, which
-- is a billing decision. Encoding a platform's current shape as a database
-- invariant buys an unmigratable copy of an opinion — this branch has already
-- rewritten this rule twice ("a public port may not have siblings", then "a
-- service may not mix public and private ports"), and a constraint would have
-- made each rewrite a migration.
--
-- Enforced instead by `public-service-is-all-http` and
-- `public-service-serves-something` in @hexclave/shared's deployments.ts, which
-- the sync route, the CLI evaluator and Marshal's validateServiceSpec all sit
-- behind — no writer reaches these columns without passing them.
