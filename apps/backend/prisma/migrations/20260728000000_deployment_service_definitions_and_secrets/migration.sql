-- Two changes that arrive together because the same rework introduced them:
--
-- 1. Service definitions move out of the branch config and into
--    DeploymentService rows (synced from the config file's `services` export by
--    `hexclave deploy`), so the rows gain the definition-only field the config
--    used to hold: the env var definitions. (The config file's `devCommand`
--    deliberately gets no column: it is consumed locally by `hexclave dev` and
--    the backend never acts on it.)
-- 2. ProjectSecret, a per-project write-only store for KMS-encrypted credential
--    values. Deployments' `secret()` env vars are its first consumer, but it is
--    deliberately not scoped or named after them.
--
-- Both tables involved are small (the Deployments app is in alpha), and PG11+
-- adds columns with constant defaults without a table rewrite, so no batching
-- sentinel is needed here.

-- AlterTable
-- definitionSyncedAt stays NULL for pre-existing rows on purpose: their
-- definitions lived in the (now-dropped) branch config section and are NOT
-- backfilled here, so deploys must refuse them until a `hexclave deploy`
-- syncs a real definition.
