/**
 * Cross-version whole-database serialization compatibility harness, used by the
 * `bulldozer-serialization-compat` GitHub Actions workflow. Where the golden fixtures freeze a known
 * shape, this proves that two *different code versions* interoperate on an entire Bulldozer database:
 *
 *   emit  <file>   build the deterministic example database, persist it, and write a self-describing
 *                  whole-database dump (KV contents + the read model the writer observed)
 *   verify <file>  load a dump written by (possibly) another code version and assert it reproduces the
 *                  exact read model (every table, group and row) its writer observed, for every table
 *                  whose rows the reading code can list
 *
 * The workflow runs `emit` under one checkout and `verify` under the other, in both directions:
 *   - new code reads a database written by base code  (backward compat: prod upgrade)
 *   - base code reads a database written by new code   (forward compat: prod rollback)
 *
 * This file (and bulldozer-db-fixture-utils.ts) is copied into the base-branch checkout by the
 * workflow, so it must only rely on the long-stable Bulldozer/piledriver public API plus the
 * checked-in example schema.
