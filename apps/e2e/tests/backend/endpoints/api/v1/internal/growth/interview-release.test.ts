/**
 * The release gate: an interview's question plan is written by the analysis but withheld from the
 * customer until a Hexclave staff member has read it. This is the ONLY human gate left in the growth
 * lifecycle — reports publish on write (report-release.test.ts).
 *
 * Seeding "plays the agent" with the shared machine secret: question plans have no customer-facing
 * write API, so that is the only way one comes into existence. The run is deliberately left RUNNING
 * rather than driven to AWAITING_INTERVIEW — every assertion here is about who may see the plan,
 * which the run's status has no say in, and driving it needs the orchestration choreography that
 * interview.test.ts owns.
 *
 * Every test batches its staff work into a single asGrowthStaff block. Entering one signs up a fresh
 * platform admin and adds them to the owner team, which is several round trips; doing that per
 * request is what pushed an earlier version of this suite past the default timeout.
