Please review the PR comments with the `gh` CLI and fix those issues that are valid and relevant. Resolve the comments when you fix them. Also resolve all those comments that no longer exist or have already been resolved. Leave those comments that are mostly bullshit unresolved. Report the result to me in detail. Do NOT automatically commit or stage the changes back to the PR!
