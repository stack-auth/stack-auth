![Onboarding welcome step](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hexclave/hexclave/dev/apps/dashboard/public/assets/changelog-onboarding-welcome.webp)

- Revamped onboarding with a welcome step to set up a new project, deploy an existing config, or just look around.
- The CLI docs page is now an install guide plus a full command reference.
- Fixed self-hosted deployments breaking after a container restart because the internal project keys were rotated.
- Unrecoverable dashboard render errors now show a retryable error screen instead of reloading forever.

## 8/7/26

- Apple sign-in now supports key-based credentials (Team ID, Key ID, and private key), with short-lived client secrets generated automatically.
- The Next.js SDK now supports Next.js 16.3.
- Impersonating a user from the dashboard now works with a single click — no more copy-pasting a script into the browser console.
- New `automaticSideEffects` constructor option in the JS SDK that makes app construction fully inert — no prefetching, query-parameter processing, storage access, or other automatic side effects until you explicitly call a method.
- Emails for low-volume tenancies are now sent immediately via a bounded burst allowance, instead of waiting in the send queue.
- Session replays now show a user overview in the header.
- Adding a trusted domain now offers a scope dropdown instead of an "add www." switch, making it clearer which subdomains are covered.
- Fixed a bug where hosted components would sometimes redirect already signed-in users to the "Welcome back" screen instead of the page they requested.
- Fixed a bug where free trials configured in Payments were not correctly synchronized to the payments layer.
- Fixed a bug where signing out would sometimes take a long time.
