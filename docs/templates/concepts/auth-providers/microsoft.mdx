This guide explains how to set up Microsoft as an authentication provider with Stack Auth. Microsoft OAuth allows users to sign in to your application using their Microsoft account.

<Info>
For Development purposes, Stack Auth uses shared keys for this provider. Shared keys are automatically created by Stack, but show Stack's logo on the OAuth sign-in page.
You should replace these before you go into production.
