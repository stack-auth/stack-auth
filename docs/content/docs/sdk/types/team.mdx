# `Team`

A `Team` object contains basic information and functions about a team, to the extent of which a member of the team would have access to it.

You can get `Team` objects with the `user.useTeams()` {/* THIS_LINE_PLATFORM react-like */} or `user.listTeams()` functions. The created team will then inherit the permissions of that user; for example, the `team.update(...)` function can only succeed if the user is allowed to make updates to the team.

# `ServerTeam`

Like `Team`, but includes additional methods and properties that require the `SECRET_SERVER_KEY`.

<TypeFromJson typeName="ServerTeam" parentTypes={["Team"]} />
