# `TeamMemberProfile`

The `TeamMemberProfile` object represents the profile of a user within the context of a team. It includes the user's profile information specific to that team.

You can access team profiles through:
- `teamUser.teamProfile` on a [`TeamUser`](./team-user.mdx) object
- `user.getTeamProfile(team)` / `user.useTeamProfile(team)` on a [`CurrentUser`](./user.mdx) object

# `ServerTeamMemberProfile`

Like `TeamMemberProfile`, but for server-side contexts with the `SECRET_SERVER_KEY`.

<TypeFromJson typeName="ServerTeamMemberProfile" parentTypes={["TeamMemberProfile"]} />
