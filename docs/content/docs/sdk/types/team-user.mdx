# `TeamUser`

The `TeamUser` object represents a user in the context of a team, providing minimal information about the user, including their ID and team-specific profile.

It is usually obtained by calling `team.useUsers()` {/* THIS_LINE_PLATFORM react-like */} or `team.listUsers()` on a [`Team` object](../types/team.mdx#team).

# `ServerTeamUser`

The `ServerTeamUser` object is used on the server side to represent a user within a team. Besides the team profile, it also includes all the functionality of a [`ServerUser`](../types/user.mdx#serveruser).

It is usually obtained by calling `serverTeam.listUsers()` on a [`ServerTeam` object](../types/team.mdx#serverteam).
