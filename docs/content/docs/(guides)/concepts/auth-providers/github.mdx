This guide explains how to set up GitHub as an authentication provider with Stack Auth. GitHub allows users to sign in to your Stack Auth-enabled app using their GitHub account.

<Info>
For Development purposes, Stack Auth uses shared keys for this provider. Shared keys are automatically created by Stack, but show Stack's logo on the OAuth sign-in page.
You should replace these before you go into production.

## Integration Steps

<Info>
If you are unsure if you need to create a GitHub App, or a GitHub OAuth App, check the [Differences On GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/differences-between-github-apps-and-oauth-apps).
More than likely, you will want to create a GitHub App. The installation process is the same for both.

  <Step>
    ### Create a GitHub App
    
    1. Navigate to your [GitHub Developer App Settings](https://github.com/settings/apps).
    2. Click the **New GitHub App** button.
    3. Enter a name for your application, homepage URL, and a description.
    4. For **Authorization callback URL**, add `https://api.stack-auth.com/api/v1/auth/oauth/callback/github`
    5. For permissions, at a **minimum**, you will need **Account Permissions > Email Addresses** set to **Read Only**. Your sign-in flow will not work without this permission.

    7. Click **Create GitHub App**
    8. Save the **Client ID** and click **Generate a new client secret** to create your **Client Secret**.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Enable GitHub Provider in Stack Auth

    2. Click **Add SSO Providers** and select **GitHub** as the provider.
