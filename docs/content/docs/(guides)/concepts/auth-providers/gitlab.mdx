This guide explains how to set up GitLab as an authentication provider with Stack Auth. GitLab OAuth allows users to sign in to your application using their GitLab account.


## Integration Steps

  <Step>
  ### Create a GitLab OAuth App
  
  1. Log in to your GitLab account.
  2. In the top-right corner, click on your profile picture and select **Preferences**.
  3. In the left sidebar, select **Applications** > **Add new application**.
  4. Fill out the form with the following details:
     - **Name**: Choose a name for your application
     - **Redirect URI**: Enter `https://api.stack-auth.com/api/v1/auth/oauth/callback/gitlab`
     - **Scopes**: Select at minimum the `profile` and `email` scopes
  5. Click **Save application**.
  6. GitLab will display your **Application ID** and **Secret**. Make note of these values as you'll need them for the next steps.
  7. If you're using a self-hosted GitLab instance, you'll also need the URL of your GitLab instance.
  </Step>

  ### Enable GitLab OAuth in Stack Auth
  
  1. On the Stack Auth dashboard, select **Auth Methods** in the left sidebar.
  2. Click **Add SSO Providers** and select **GitLab** as the provider.
  3. Set the **Application ID** and **Secret** you obtained from GitLab earlier.
  4. If you're using a self-hosted GitLab instance, you'll also need to provide the URL for your instance. For gitlab.com, you can leave this field blank or use the default value.
