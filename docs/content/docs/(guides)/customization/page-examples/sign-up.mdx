This page provides examples of how to create custom sign-up pages for your application using Stack Auth components and functions.

## Custom page with `SignUp` component

<PlatformCodeblock 
  document="customization/sign-up"
  examples={["default"]}
/>

You can also use `useUser` at the beginning of the sign-up page to check whether the user is already signed in and redirect them to another page if they are.

## Other useful components

`CredentialSignUp`: A component that renders a complete form for signing up with email and password. It handles validation, error states, and submission automatically.

`OAuthGroup`: A component that displays a list of available OAuth provider sign-up buttons. The available provider list is automatically fetched from the server based on your project configuration.

`OAuthButton`: A component that renders a single OAuth sign-up button for a specific provider. Use this when you only want to offer specific OAuth providers.
