This section covers the core authentication patterns and flows you'll need to implement secure authentication in your Python application using Stack Auth's REST API.

## Authentication Patterns

Each authentication flow addresses specific use cases:

- **API Setup**: Foundation for all authentication operations
- **User Sessions**: Managing authenticated user state and session lifecycle  
- **OAuth Flows**: Social login integration (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- **Server Validation**: Securing your API endpoints and validating requests

## Getting Started

Start with [API Setup & Configuration](./api-setup) to establish your Python client, then proceed to the specific authentication flow that matches your application's needs.

For framework-specific integration examples, see the [Framework Integration](../integration) section.
