// Webhook declarations for the `issue.*` family.
//
// Unlike the other files in this directory these are not backed by a `createCrud` call: issues have no public
// REST surface yet (the dashboard talks to `/internal/issues*`, whose shapes live in `../admin-issues`), so
// the webhook payload is the only externally-visible issue contract. It is declared standalone, the same way
// `webhookTeamDeletedSchema` is in `./teams.ts`.
//
// `status` and `substatus` are imported from `../admin-issues` rather than restated: the webhook's `status` is
// literally the stored `Issue.status`, so a second copy of the enum could only ever drift out of agreement
// with the thing it describes.

/**
 * `short_id` and `times_seen` are strings, not numbers, and that is not a style choice.
 *
 * Both are Postgres `BigInt`. `apps/backend/src/route-handlers/smart-response.tsx` runs `JSON.stringify` over
 * the response body, and `JSON.stringify` THROWS on a BigInt rather than coercing it — so a numeric field here
 * would take down the request that tried to emit the webhook. They cross the wire as decimal strings, and a
 * consumer that needs arithmetic should use `BigInt(...)` rather than `Number(...)`: `times_seen` on a busy
 * project can exceed `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`.
 *
 * The `*_at_millis` fields are safe as numbers — epoch millis stay well inside the safe integer range.
 *
 * This is a builder rather than one shared schema constant because of the `status`/`substatus` EXAMPLES: the
 * payload shape is identical across the five `issue.*` events, but the emitter
 * (`apps/backend/src/lib/issues/issue-webhooks.ts`) sends event-determined values — `issue.created` always
 * carries substatus `new`, `issue.regressed` carries `regressed`, and the human-action events carry `ongoing`
 * with the status matching the action. One shared example ("regressed" everywhere) made the generated docs
 * show impossible payloads for four of the five events.
